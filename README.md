# Simple NPM Registry Prototype
Simply trying to recreate an NPM registry in C# mostly using the docs, 
and the tool it self, this is mostly some exploratory work, 
as it will most likely be ported to GoLang possibly to work into a GOGS fork.
## Current Functionality
- [x] Publish
- [x] Install
- [ ] Login
- [ ] Orgs
- [ ] Everything else

## This tool
This tool should only be used internally, this is partly due to it's current development.
When a package is requested that the tool does not have, it will forward it to the public repository.
And of cource, I'm not and neither is the tool affiliated with NPM Inc.
This is all for fun, and just trying to recreate it so it might be usefull for other projects like stated before.
